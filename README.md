# first-project
Testing how GitHub works

That first project was created to test how add, commit and push a project into github.
In this project you can find a LED controlled by interrupt Timer. I create a Counter of Seconds by interrupt Timer and that counter is turn-on or turn-off my LED.

That's All and tks Felipe from Dev Samurai who teach me how use this.
